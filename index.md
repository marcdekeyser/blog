# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
I'm Marc Dekeyser, an cloud enthousiast currently working for the Microsoft Azure App Consult team. Started in IT in 2004 and have helped many customers customers in multiple industries in their cloud journey ever since! My expertise lies in the Microsoft cloud, but way (way!) back I started in Microsoft Exchange, took on Microsoft Lync, and rolled into BPOS & Azure from there.
